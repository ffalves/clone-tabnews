# clone-tabnews


## About
This project is a study initiative aimed at developing a full clone of the TabNews website from scratch. The project is part of practical exercises from the curso.dev by [Felipe Deschamps](https://github.com/filipedeschamps), the original creator of TabNews.

* Inspiring in the README format from [LuizBarel](https://github.com/LuizBarel/clone-tabnews), I'll include notes about the course classes. *

**Technologies:**
- Next.js
- React
- Git and Github

**Key project files**
- files ending with "rc": contains "run commands" that are used to automate execution of specific commands within the project's scripts.
- `.nvmrc`: this file specifies the Node.js version to be used in the project, set here to `lts/hydrogen`.
- `lts`: stands for "long-term support"and indicates that this version will receive extended support and maintenance from the community.
- `package.json`: a key file containing metadata about the project, including the author's details, licence information, project description, and a list of dependencies (such as libraries and modules required for the project).
